My name is Adam Canosa. I?m a full-time music educator with 11 years? experience. I?m also the developer of a game-based, adaptive music education platform known as Songcraft. I single-handedly built the initial version of Songcraft for my students as we returned from the COVID pandemic to a classroom in which we were unable to sing or play many instruments. The tool had enormous success with my students which led to my decision to pursue my Masters degree in Educational Entrepreneurship which has been instrumental (pun intended) for learning how to properly design and scale an educational innovation. My goals are to secure more funding to bring Songcraft to market by the 2024-2025 school year. I also aim to develop and carry out a research project utilizing Songcraft as an intervention.

During March 2020, I traveled to Guatemala to build a home with the From Houses to Homes club at UNC. I left the country hours before they locked all borders due to the pandemic. In my free time, I visited local markets and found that many artists do not receive the majority of profits from the sale of their artwork. Artists sell their work to middlemen to avoid barriers such as market fees, transportation, etc. I decided that I wanted to do something to tackle these issues and was given the opportunity to do so after receiving the Eve Carson Scholarship. With this funding, I returned to Guatemala in March 2021 to buy art directly from Guatemalan artists and help them reap the benefits of their work. The profits from ACI are donated to From Houses to Homes, which provides pathways out of poverty for low-income Guatemalans. My venture consists of buying art directly from Guatemalan artists to provide them with steady business and form lasting connections. This art is then resold in the U.S. to spread awareness and appreciation for Guatemalan culture and artists. We are able to offer competitive prices for our original artwork because we cut out middlemen by buying directly from artists or their friends and family. Overall ACI tackles three main issues: lack of access to affordable, original, ethically-sourced artwork in the U.S., Guatemalan artists not receiving profits from their work, and From Houses to Homes' lack of reliable and consistent funding. There are not many competitors selling original artwork from Guatemala in the U.S. other than Novica, Unicef Marketplace, Etsy vendors, etc. Although these groups sell artwork from Guatemala, their focus is much more broad in terms of origin of the artwork and types of art. There are also galleries, small businesses, and other organizations that sell original artwork in the U.S., but most do not have a focus on paying artists fairly or they are for profit organizations unlike my venture. Looking at the broader market, competitors could include anywhere one could buy artwork/decor, even large players such as Target and Walmart. However, I am aiming for a more niche market interested in supporting a nonprofit venture by purchasing original artwork that is ethically sourced and fair to the artists.

This system trains a player's mind and body through muscle memory training to become the mind and body of a world class footballer. We have built an entire system by users for users off of the knowledge of how long one must train to earn the skills of a world class athlete. I have also done a lot of research on the football marketplace and the marketplace in general. This research has culminated in 4 studies and 4 designed experiments on the football marketplace. All of my predictions came true in all of my designed experiments. Part of this research is an innovative management information system that trains a person to efficiently compile big data on any industry and build companies and products for an industry based on the needs of consumers. I am initially selling 4 products from this process: 1 consumer product for use in people's homes, 2 professional products built as solutions from the big data, and 1 professional product that is the consumer product with added features for professionals. My company follows the social contract between the corporation and consumers that the corporation will produce great products at prices consumers can afford with their wages so that they come back to the corporation to buy again and again providing for the speedy progress of the corporation, consumer, and society. We aim to deliver exceptional value to consumers by building and executing on great products.

Borderless Mobility GmbH,Borderless Mobility GmbH; Reveox,www.reveox.com,Other,9/6/2018,Leon Pietschmann,,,,Ludwig-Wilhelm- Str.3,Karlsruhe,,76131,,mail@borderless-mobility.com,,"Short: Reveox is a platform for free (or at least cheap) mobility. With reveox you can find a free rental car on selected routs throughout the country. Reveox itself pulls the offers from major rental car agencies, that need the cars to be relocated, and therefore makes relocating cars a lot more efficient. At the moment we have up to 100 rides every day in Germany. Problem: When managing a fleet many companies, especially car rentals agencies, encounter the problem of having to relocate cars to another location. Relocating a car today is a very expensive process, mainly because you need to pay for fuel, the driver and for the driver to get back home. But what if you could get rid of these three major costs? Our solution: With our platform, we mediate these relocations offers to people, mainly students, looking for a cheap way to travel, thus saving everyone a lot of money. Every day there are a few thousand people that could potentially relocate the cars, but since they don?t know about the need for the car to be relocated they take the bus, train or plane. But whats missing is a platform that shows alternative options to cheaply (maybe even for free!) travel those routes. That?s exactly what reveox wants to be. We want to be the first website you check when you need to go somewhere and taking a car is a possible option. Target Group: We want to target travelers on a budget that appreciate driving a rental car more than sitting on the bus for hours.

At Capio Biosciences we are currently developing an advanced platform called CapioCyte? for the capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from whole blood. By utilizing a combination of biomimetic cell rolling and dendrimer-mediated multivalent cell capture, CapioCyte delivers significantly greater capture sensitivity than other platforms currently available. It is also able to provide enriched CTCs for post capture molecular analysis such as FISH, RNA-Seq and NGS. CapioCyte is therefore an excellent tool for today?s cancer research needs, and potentially for clinical patient management in the future.

Eye biometric data is highly valuable for medical research and clinical applications to detect and track dysfunctions in arousal responses of patients suffering from neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. The devices we propose use infrared light diffusing through the eye to measure pupil size, eye motion, heart and respiratory rates. Our technology measures all these data far more efficiently than the current state of the art, with a single device that minimally burdens patients, and with sampling capabilities that are orders of magnitude faster than alternate, image-based technologies. Medical applications exist in personalized medicine where our technology can detect unexpected hypo and hyper arousal states in real-time, and enable fast actions that best benefit neurodivergent patients. Our technology will also find applications in consumer electronics. Integrated in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality headsets, our minimally invasive and precise eye-tracking capabilities can improve hands-free navigation and 3D image rendering with fovea-optimized displays matched to the eye?s direction. Arousal tracking capabilities can provide neural feedback to the computer to measure attention, interest, and reactions to displayed content. Together, these new capabilities can dramatically improve the ability to simulate immersive 3D environments in high demand within the video gaming industry. Our technology can be integrated into personal protective and safety equipment and track early symptoms of fatigue and low attention for operators of dangerous machinery.","license effective 5/6/2024 per OTC/Carmen, 7/22/2024","No website found, NC SoS status as ""Current - active,"" latest annual report 1/19/2023.

Most hot sauces are so hot that ""just a dot will do"". Chaza is more of a condiment you will want to slather on, hence the bigger flask style bottle! It has been accurately described as a combination of a hot sauce and bbq sauce. Chaza Southern Hot Sauce- don't worry, this tangy and twangy sauce is not TOO hot! Its habanero peppers and seasonings combined with a vinegar and mustard kick. Matt originally created it as a wing sauce but now we hear of people pouring it on eggs, tacos, or as my mom experimented recently, her Brunswick stew! A family favorite shortcut dinner is to put frozen chicken breasts in your crock pot with Chaza. Shred and serve with slaw but don't forget more Chaza on the bun!

City Bird,"City Bird, LLC",www.citybird.org,LLC - Limited Liability,8/29/2022,Alberto Delgado,,,,,Chapel Hill,North Carolina,,Orange,jinbai194@gmail.com,,"Every year, millions of birds are killed when they fly into windows. Birds, unlike humans, cannot understand or learn the concept of glass as an invisible barrier. Glass could appear as trees for birds to fly into, whether trees are reflected or seen through. This is particularly problematic during seasonal migrations in the spring and fall when birds make the long journey from South America to North America. The sad reality is that countless birds do not make their journey due to the harmful effects of human intervention on the environment and rapid urbanization. City Bird is a nonprofit organization created to help our community protect birds in urban environments. City Bird was founded by Alberto Valido and Jin Bai, two Ph.D. students from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. We are already conducting community organizing and advocacy to save birds in the triangle and are very passionate about this project. In the fall of 2021 and spring of 2022, we conducted a bird-window collision monitoring survey that brought together a team of 20 volunteers to survey potentially hazardous buildings at the UNC-Chapel Hill campus. The survey showed that several buildings in our community pose a prominent threat to birds. For example, there has been a total of 170 bird-window collisions at Wilson Hall at the UNC-Chapel Hill campus over the past few years, and little has been done to mitigate the collision impacts (data based on a UNC Biology professor, an iNaturalist project, and our structured surveys since the fall of 2021). We are currently organizing a new monitoring project, and over 90 student volunteers have signed up to survey buildings at both UNC and NCSU over the 2022 Fall migration season. Visit https://www.citybird.org/projects to learn more about our survey sites at UNC and NCSU. We created City Bird to bring awareness to this critical issue and to create a citizen science project for our community to monitor bird-window collisions in the triangle area of NC. Our project is to create a mobile App that anyone could use to record an observation of a bird-window collision. This will provide critical data needed to convince policymakers and land owners to modify their buildings to make them safer for birds. Users will be able to snap a picture of a building and an observed collision incident. It will automatically be entered into a database along with the location of the observation, weather conditions, and details of the event. The app will also encourage users to learn more about birds by including a social component where more knowledgeable birders identify the species and collectively improve the quality of bird-window collision observations. Thus, this project will not only benefit science and bird conservation but will be an important tool to bring science education to all members of the community. This way, we will be able to crowdsource scientific observations of bird-window collisions to any member of the public, allowing them to feel passionate about bird conservation and the impact humans have on the environment. Further, the app will be designed to engage users that are new or not previously interested in bird conservation by including an attractive and modern user interface. We will also build a competitive component where users will be able to see how they compare to other reporters in the area (e.g., a list of top ten reporters). We will also have a point or scoring system where users obtain prestige or ?karma? points by correctly identifying the bird in the observation or reporting the greatest number of observations. Additionally, the app will encourage users to visit buildings by promoting fitness goals such as keeping track of how many steps or calories they spend inspecting buildings around them. On many occasions, users will not find an injured bird when they inspect a site, we will motivate engagement in monitoring efforts by hosting events within the app, such as a ?big count day? where everyone will be prompted to visit selected buildings to survey bird-window collisions. Another potential feature of the app is to promote community cohesion by encouraging collaborations between observers in the same geographical area. The app will encourage users to survey sites as a group in local areas and to identify and survey hazardous sites. To make the app even more interactive to the public, future iterations will introduce geolocated collector items for people to feel motivated to visit these sites. People will be able to find digital birds hiding in different buildings. Then they will be able to adopt the birds and take care of them. To keep the digital birds healthy, users will be prompted to collect other items such as seeds, feeders, and other bird-related items by visiting buildings and monitoring collisions. To make this happen, we will use augmented reality where users can see their adopted digital birds following them around. Our plans also include a research component incorporating AI and machine learning to gather information about building characteristics that pose harm to birds. We plan to include a way for reporters to conduct a 3D scan of the building using their cellphones, which will be used to identify what building characteristics may have caused the incident such as the shape and dimensions of the window and weather conditions that may increase the risk of impact. Collecting this information will allow us to improve future building designs to make them safer for birds. Further, all data from this project will be publicly available to researchers interested in bird conservancy in urban areas. There are many isolated efforts across the United States to monitor bird-window collisions. However, these efforts have been limited to a small number of researchers with no or little involvement from the public. City Bird will create a unified framework to organize all those efforts into a standardized and reproducible data collection tool that will have the backing and support of the general public. To achieve this, we will conduct community events in the Raleigh and Durham natural science museums, the NC Botanical Garden, and the NC Zoo to educate children and adolescents about urban bird conservation and engage them in the citizen science project. We will also host community events such as bird walks, workshops, and speaker series to bring awareness to the prevention of bird-window collisions. Further, we will have a modern website where we will inform the community about the organization's progress in app development, bird-window collision monitoring, and advocacy. The website will also include an interactive dashboard with maps for people to identify where most observations are being recorded and become motivated to visit more buildings. The long-term goal of our venture is much more ambitious. We aim to make the app widely available and collect data across multiple cities, states, and countries worldwide. We plan to relocate our headquarters to Washington, D.C., and become a leading technology company to make bird conservation the norm and not the exception. We will use the data we collect and the civic engagement we promote to create real change in bird conservation. We will advocate for laws that mandate real estate companies adopt bird-friendly building designs and preventative strategies in existing buildings. We will also do community-engaged activism in buildings that require the most urgent interventions to ensure that adequate plans are established to ensure the buildings do not pose significant harm to birds. An important part of our business model will be to not only benefit science and the public but offer solutions to bird-window collision incidents. Research shows that simple strategies such as installing stickers on windows that alert birds of the risks can significantly reduce bird injury and deaths. Our website will fundraise by selling products anyone can purchase to reduce the incidence of bird-window collisions in their buildings. Anecdotal evidence shows that when a person is made aware of this problem, they can recall at least one incident where they encountered a bird victim of a window collision. Our app will make them able to do something to prevent bird-window collisions and will enable them to contribute to conservation efforts. There is an innate tendency for people to help those who are innocent and helpless. Birds worldwide are daily victims of human?s harmful impact on the environment and their habitats. Our project relies on the goodwill of caring people with the kindness to conserve the rich biodiversity of birds for future generations. We attempt to answer a very clear problem (bird deaths due to window collisions) with a very clear solution (community engagement, monitoring, and advocacy). As such, our enterprise has all the elements to succeed and become a bird conservation leader worldwide. In summary, we have identified a very specific problem we care deeply about and devised a business plan to make our project a reality. This funding is critical to our growth as a company and will make all the difference by providing us with the mentorship, networking, and material resources we need to make City Bird a success.",,"NC registration and website active (Patrick, 2/28/23) Current - Active on NC Site, NC Annual Report Filed 3/23/23, website active (Juliana, 5/24/23) NC SoS status ""Dissolved"" but company website data is still up to date as of 5/3/24, website active, added email address (John 5/4/24).",,,,

Teams with a collaborative atmosphere are more productive and innovative than those that prioritize internal competition. However, professionals? isolation at the desk and communication via smartphone limit in-person interactions, sense of belonging, and likely productivity and innovation. Cseda offers a product that increases and enriches interactions, called Strength^n ?Strength to the power of ?n.?? Already successful in groups of 35 to 200 people, this activity shuffles a participant list into randomized combinations (3- or 4-somes). Participants then set up a lunch, coffee, a walk, etc. After a set time interval, the participant list is re-shuffled to create new combinations that maximally avoid previous combinations. The inherent randomization places participants together in new combinations. The casual meetings facilitated by Strength^n have elicited anonymous feedback attesting to increases in quality of work experience, new perspectives, and appreciating colleagues? dignity. Strength^n has been used to shuffle participants within a ?rank? (i.e. faculty), and also between ranks (faculty and students). The latter strategy substantively improves the civility of power dynamics and provides diversified mentoring for trainees. To commercialize Strengthn, Cseda, LLC was launched. ?C? and ?seda? are how the word ?silk? is pronounced in Mandarin and Spanish, weaving the concept of resilient links with the synthesis of diversified cultural awareness. The Strength^n administrator tool is available via a web interface, and runs quickly and simply on any computer.

Cubicle,Underscore Games LLC,get.cubiclegame.com,LLC - Limited Liability,11/17/2020,Daniel Rabinovich,,,,,Charlotte,North Carolina,,Mecklenburg,,,"Cubicle, by Underscore Games, is a party game that makes fun of corporate culture, built for employee engagement and house parties alike. It's the first party game that tackles the corporate space, and attacks both the B2B and B2C markets, which can be played both in the office space to boost employee engagement and retention, while being a game that can be played at home with friends and family. Currently, we are building Cubicle, a party game that makes fun of corporate culture through various challenges, improvisatory battles, and more. It's the first party game that tackles the corporate space, and attacks both the B2B and B2C markets, which can be played both in the office space to boost employee engagement and retention, while being a game that can be played at home with friends and family. Within the game, Cubicle contains four distinct card types: Supplies and Excuses, (known as Incentives), and Reviews and Team Buildings, (known as Directives). Players begin by drawing a card out of a shuffled directives pile once during their turn, and either get a Review, or a Team Building card. Team Building cards are group activities players will do that involve a variety of different challenges, for example, in ?Round of Golf?, players will use resources around them to create a DIY golf-ball (balled up paper for instance), a DIY golf club (a metal ruler for instance), and a DIY hole, (a turned-over mug for instance) and each attempt to make a shot, which if successful, will earn incentives. Reviews are one on one improvisatory battles that have one player act as a supervisor, and accuse another player of a particular misconduct within the workplace. Players are given the opportunity to rebuttal and improvise their way out of the accusation, or justify their argument, using their excuse cards. For instance, one player may draw a review card on their turn that says ?Breakroom Brawl?, and accuses another player of starting a fight in the breakroom, who then defends with an excuse card in their hand that says ?Pyramid Scheme?, implying that it was because of an elaborate crime scheme that a fight occurred, and had nothing to do with the player. Players go back and forth in improv to determine a winner or trip the other person up, and the rest of the players vote on a winner after the end of a review. The first player to win three reviews wins.

A magnetic current loop is divided into k sections. Each of the k sections has a series reactance. Series reactive compensation is added to each of the k sections such that the reactive compensation substantially cancels the series reactance of each section. Adding reactive compensation to the loop that cancels the series reactance of each section of the loop provides current magnitude and phase uniformity along the loop at any given instant in time. As a result, the magnitude and phase of the magnetic field at a point in space can be controlled with precision to achieve a desired result, such as precise field cancellation or precise field generation.","Liquidation, close down",6/1/2002,,

Treatment occurs in a premium outfitted mobile clinic using state of the art equipment and cutting-edge therapies. Golfers receive individualized treatment by Titleist certified doctors who consider your unique fitness level and ability. Whether the need is health maintenance, pain relief, or injury treatment, Drive PT is conveniently located at your golf course - accessible after hours and weekends. No referrals necessary. DRIVE PT provides customized physical therapy treatment based on the patients? needs and goals. Treatment can vary based on many factors, including player ability, injury, mobility, strength, and age. DRIVE PT matches the players goals with the appropriate treatment plan. Each golfer will receive a combination of wellness treatments, maintenance therapy, strengthening exercises, balance activities, mobility/flexibility exercises, and education. However, the amount and type of each treatment technique is adjusted to fit the goals of the patient. For example, a junior golfer primarily requires education and strength training. They already possess greater mobility and flexibility, and do not have chronic issues. Meanwhile a senior golfer will typically present with limited mobility and flexibility, as well as chronic injuries and comorbidities. The junior golfer aspires to becoming a PGA Tour player, while the senior golfer appreciates the sense of community that golf brings them and wishes to participate without pain.

While the significance of anti-inflammatory treatment was realized in the 1990s, there remains a lack of drug therapies aimed toward treating the powerful and relentless inflammation in CF patients. Eldec Pharmaceuticals is dedicated to meet the urgent need for an effective anti-inflammatory therapeutic to treat chronic lung disease in CF patients. Inhibition of Orai1-induced Ca2+ influx has been proposed as a therapy for reducing inflammation. We have solved SPLUNC1's crystal structure and identified a domain called the a6 region that binds the Orai1 calcium channel. Thus, replacement of SPLUNC1 with this peptide may serve as a therapeutic approach to reduce inflammation in CF patients. We have designed new a6 peptide mutants that have improved stability in CF sputum without binding to mucus. We are evaluating the ability of these peptides to control cytosolic calcium levels via inhibition of Orai1. Finally, we are using mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to determine if the peptides are capable of controlling inflammation. As mentioned before, novel anti-inflammatory therapy is crucial and urgently needed to treat inflammation in CF patients.""","incorporated DE, NC Mailing Address: 6607 Manor Hill Ct.

Low income families face many challenges in terms of obtaining and preparing healthy food, particularly if working multiple jobs and facing the many demands of poverty.

Similar to the Tom's Shoes' model, we are producing healthy frozen meals to be sold at a higher price at higher end retailers and university campuses for consumers who value convenient healthy prepared food options sourced locally. We will sell the same product for a much lower price (subsidized) in small grocery and convenience stores in food deserts.

Renters utilize the service to easily find competitively-priced and geographically comparable spots to rent for at least one month. Sparc differs from other parking platforms through its focus on the niche but vast market segment of long-term parkers. This enables the development of an expertise in service offerings and user experience and avoids the logistical and capital-intensive process of managing short-term parking and enforcement. Along with Sparc?s ability to organize, track and facilitate payments and provide pricing and geographic visibility, Sparc is looking to differentiate itself through hardware retail, insurance agreements, and protected pricing software. Strategic pricing software would be focused on increasing user retention, managing market competition, and balancing both supply and demand. Insurance agreements between spot renters and spot owners would not only protect Sparc but also provide an extra value-add for users enticed by fee-free indirect competitors (unsecure venmo transactions and communication & connection over Facebook or Craigslist).

Through the sales of watersports apparel crafted from sustainable materials such as discarded clothing and plastic harvested from our oceans, we are out to fight fast fashion and support ocean conservation. (The clothing industry is the second largest polluter in the world...second only to oil.) We promise our customers thoughtfully designed and highly functional items made from only the most environmentally-friendly textiles sourced from the most worker-friendly suppliers. We stand behind our products with a three-part pledge of ?Looks good, works good, does good? and a lifetime guarantee. We stand up for our planet by donating a percentage of profits to local and national non-profits as well as encouraging environmental activism. Our first line of products will be bikinis, board shorts, t-shirts, and tank tops. The bathing suits will be made with RPET fabric (recycled plastics) and the clothing items will be made from highly sustainable materials such as bamboo and coconut fiber. Even organic cotton is not good enough for us. Our company is exciting because we check every box. Yes, there are companies out there making bikinis from RPET, but they are not sports-functional. Or there is a company making sports-functional bikinis, but not from sustainable materials. There are companies that make clothing from sustainable materials, but not watersports apparel. We will differentiate from existing competitors by checking all the boxes: watersports apparel, actually sustainable, highly functional, built to last, and aggressively mission-driven to support ocean conservation. With time, we hope to expand beyond our surfwear line to grow to be one of the largest outdoor apparel companies in the U.S. However, because of our founder?s expertise and network in the watersports industry, we felt we were uniquely positioned to start at the beach.","additional information from applicants: Yes ? 2 things: 1- I am debating between organizing as a B-Corp or as non-profit. I need to learn more about non-profits and the restrictions they face, but it is an option I would like to consider. I believe as a non-profit I may be able to give more money away for environmental conservation. However, I do like the idea that as a for-profit, our products would be a part of customers' everyday purchasing decisions (as opposed to being thought of as a special donation), and would better teach people to be conscious consumers. 2- I would like to tell you a little about my background and why I feel qualified to lead this company into the market we have selected. I grew up on the water and started sailing when I was eight years old. I raced sailboats competitively all throughout my childhood, including as my high school sport. I was a varsity athlete in college on the sailing team, and we won National Championships twice. My college also had a windsurfing club, and I dedicated my free time in my last semester to learning how to windsurf. I moved to the Outer Banks of North Carolina the day after graduation so I could follow my passion for watersports. While living in the Outer Banks and working at a watersports shop, I got into kiteboarding, stand-up paddle boarding, and surfing. I worked in the watersports recreation industry for six years before moving to Chapel Hill to attend Kenan-Flagler. My personal network and professional experience that spans multiple watersports industries will inform the decisions I make as leader of Flowe & Co.","Likely dissolved, but need to confirm.

As we transitioned to telehealth, I found myself, as a provider, clicking into new patient visits and finding my patient sitting in their hot car, on break from work, on a poor data connection, and I had absolutely no history on them. It would be an awkward game of 50 questions with them only hearing 30, just to get a partial history. I was frustrated, there had to be a way to get information from the patient to me before the visit. I'm the kind who would daydream about cloning myself into their phone to ask questions before the visit. I dreamed of a report it would generate to get me off with a good start with charting. No more charting when I got home at night! Relating to the patient- I love being a mental health provider, but I woke one day to find that I was no longer the wise middle-aged white 'expert' patients wanted. I'd see a patient of diversity who I knew asked for a provider of diversity, and they got me. I'd see a teen of color in the adolescent unit and they would barely look me in the eye. I'd see a non-binary teen and while I think I relate well - I use the right pronouns and understand the right and wrong things to ask. But I don't have any color tint in my hair that shows authenticity. I kept wishing I was someone else. Someone who could get me the information I needed to put together a great mental health plan. Solution- I worked out a way to clone myself into their phone with a pretty amazing web app and I worked the technology to get it to generate that report I wanted in the chart, then I went and multiplied my clones and changed them into guides of all colors and diversities...... and Inclusive Intakes was born!","Incorporated in DE, File Number: 4360920, Tiffany, 2-23-23","DE incorporation and website active (Patrick, 2/28/23) Incorporated in DE, website active (Juliana, 6/9/23) DE registration and website active (John 4/22/24).",,,,

Through our primary market research, we learned high school students want clearer information about what comes after graduation but it is difficult to find answers to these questions. These questions are more pronounced and require more nuance for applicants who are first-generation, first in their family to attend college, from marginalized backgrounds, neurodiverse, and identify as a member of the LGBTQ community. After months of conducting customer discovery interviews and doing primary and secondary market research, we learned the most salient questions high school students have about college fall into the following five categories: 1) Competitive Scale: How competitive is a college once I arrive? Do students have study groups and share notes? Are they competing against each other for graduate school? Does competition vary amongst programs within a school? 2) How collaborative is a school? Is there a sense of esprit de corps or is there fierce individualism? Is there big school spirit or too cool for school? 3) How does the campus support students who are first-gen, first in their family, neurodiverse, from marginalized backgrounds, and members of the LGBTQ community? What impasses are these groups experiencing while attending school? 4) What is campus life like when students are not in class? Is the school a commuter campus ? students leave if not attending a class or is it students? new home and home and community? 5) What is the social scene? Do students socialize in dorms and have dorm parties? Are students gathering off-campus at houses in small groups? Do most students congregate at places where you need to be 21 or are they hanging out at huge Greek life house parties? ? Students will be able to click boxes that match their interests and from there they will receive a list of matching schools. This will be accompanied by written reviews detailing students? experience at the college and include posted videos on social media about what it is like to attend that particular school. ? There will also be links to each school's admissions requirements and information ? Prospective applicants will then be taken a window that says, ?Are you interested in applying to this school?? If the applicant clicks ?Yes?, then the admissions deadlines information will be auto-populated into the applicants? calendar(s). How parents interact with this website. Parents and students must agree that this tool will be their main tool to communicate. Through our customer discovery interviews and through or primary market research, we learned the college admissions process is disliked and creates stress within the family. Most of this stress surrounds communication between parents and applicants and the meeting of deadlines. We loop in parents by giving them information that is like Niche. We learned parents like Niche but not applicants. Like the applicants, parents will create a profile on our website and be able to review and select schools they think would be a match for their applicants. Parent information will be narrative-based as opposed to videos. ------------ How we connect applicants and parents: Beginning of Junior year, parents and applicants will register for this service. Both will be able to begin selecting schools. They will also receive monthly updates. An applicant?s emails will include: ?These schools are also potential matches with your criteria? ?New videos about your school have been posted? ?Your parent selected ____________ colleges are potential fits? A parent?s emails will include: ?These schools are also potential matches with your criteria? ?Your applicants selected ____________ colleges are potential fits? Emails will include reminders about deadlines and the materials that need to be submitted --------------- What?s new about us? We are transforming how applicants and parents experience the college selection process. For decades finding the right college meant students looked at schools based on location, size, and admissions data. As mentioned, through our extensive customer discovery interviews, we learned these domains do not seem to be correlated with student happiness once enrolled at university. As such, we are providing information on the most salient features associated with student satisfaction during their first two years of college. In fact, the more intact these features seem to be associated with improved self-confidence, academic happiness, social well-being and increase the likelihood a student will broaden his or her horizons. We learned from our interviews both parents and applicants find this process to be wholly unpleasant. To address this, families with substantial disposable income often hire a private college counselor, whose services are often hundreds of dollars an hour. Much to our surprise, we discovered the most valuable service these professionals provide is in the organizing of materials. The counselor also served as a mouthpiece to communicate for the other person without the two parties speaking verbally. Notably, very few people reported their counselors were worth the investment. With this in mind, we found a way to provide the same concierge organizational support. Equity: The college selection process raises several issues related to equity. Private college counselors are available to only certain demographics. We learned when interviewing high school counselors and from people who work in college access organizations (i.e., AVID) the priority for high school guidance counselors is for students to graduate. Because the average ratio of students to a counselor is 700:1 (Source: Independent Educational Consultants Association), it is very difficult for secondary students to receive adequate support. This tool broadens the access of informing high school students what their post-secondary options are without the hefty price tag. Potential Market: Through our secondary market research, we learned that each year 20 million students apply to college, and approximately 4 million use a private tutor. This means there are potentially 16 million college applicants who would use our tool.",,"The website is active, no incorporation/company information found, 7-3-22-Tiffany Active on CA website, but missed 2022 deadline for statement of information and last SOI filing was in 2021 (Juliana, 5/24/23) Website inactive, no company info found (John 4-16-24).","Liquidation, close down",1/1/2021,,

Multiple studies have concluded that weekly, sports-related programming improves scores on both physical and mental health assessments. Jump rope programs specifically have been studied extensively in Hong Kong, China, and Australia. For example, the Rope Skipping STAR Programme has been shown to significantly improve vital capacity, heart rate, and step index for elementary students. A literature review of after-school programs for at-risk youth showed that the most effective programs are not just based off sports though - instead they are multi-component. This is why we are combining jump rope with the success of nutrition education to foster positive health behavior change. We want to continue learning about this programming in a US-specific context, which has not actually been studied before. Our pilot test here in Chapel Hill will provide a good first step, but we will need to keep expanding to diverse communities across the country to get the best results. Incorporating sound public health theory and research tools will help us accurately understand our impact. By working with faculty in the Gillings School of Global Public Health, and connecting with similar nutrition education programs like TABLE NC, we will be able to get the resources we need to grow successfully.

The mission of our company is to improve maternal health outcomes through a home-based early detection of complications like preeclampsia and eclampsia. Preeclampsia is the second leading cause of maternal mortalities worldwide, despite the condition being straightforward to manage if detected early. Symptoms are subtle, often leaving women unaware of the developing complications unless they attend regular prenatal care checkups. Left undiagnosed, the condition becomes eclampsia, which leads to organ failure, seizure activity, and serious or fatal health effects for both mother and unborn child. Kalia Health is designing the EPED (early preeclampsia detection) strip. The EPED strip is a urine-based, point-of-care early detection test that measures elevated levels of protein biomarkers indicative of preeclampsia. Expecting mothers can use the EPED strip at home to periodically self-screen for the development of preeclampsia, so they know when the complication is beginning and can choose to seek preventative care before her symptoms become severe and endanger the life of her and her unborn child. Without routine prenatal care screenings, increasing individual awareness about developing complications and providing women with the tools they need to take control of their own health is essential to reducing the burden of preeclampsia and eclampsia. We believe our product has the potential to prevent adverse outcomes and save the lives of thousands of mothers and babies, but to do so, we must to do more than develop and sell. Participation in the showcase will provide our company the opportunity to learn from others with similar goals and with entrepreneurial experience, gain new insights to help us push our company forward, and to find potential collaborators, mentors, and business partners.","incorporated DE and NC Minority team, female led, US-based Updated address from Happy (Suvomita) Ghosh in Jan '24 (Cindy, 2/8/2024)","Annual report filed NC 2/8/19.

In a time when technology plays a role in all aspects of our lives, it has become imperative that students are prepared to enter a world where understanding technology is a necessity. Kids Code aims to provide code education to students in grades eighth through twelfth by delivering a project based curriculum through a three week summer intensive program. This intensive will provide students with hands on opportunities to create a website, game, etc, and then present at a STEM showcase. In order to reach students from low income communities, Kids Code is implementing a sponsorship model in partnership with local STEM teachers. Teachers at local schools will be able to nominate students passionate about computer science to attend our program free of charge. Furthermore, Kids Code hopes to break a few of the stereotypes that surround the computer science field. One misconception that we hope to attempt to break at is that coding is often viewed as a solitary act. Is is important for us as coding program to foster a collaborative space. In order to amplify collaboration, we hope to incorporate a team structure into our project based curriculum. Kids Code hopes to establish programs throughout the state of North Carolina and Georgia. Kids Code initially began in Savannah, Georgia during my time in high school as Savannah Kids Code. Today, the program continues to offer free coding workshops on Saturdays at one of the branches of the Savannah Public Library system.

This pivotal last step, surprisingly overlooked by most existing solutions, frequently results in unexpected delays, inconveniencing both the driver and the awaiting customer. Here's what sets our solution apart: User-Driven Visual Mapping: We empower recipients to visually map a precise route to their doorstep. These visuals act as a more intuitive and localized guide than generic maps. Accompanied by recipients? comments and navigation suggestions from past drivers, this feature transforms the previously ambiguous final leg of the delivery journey into a clear, well-defined path. AI-Enhanced Deliverability Scoring: With the integration of advanced AI algorithms, our app calculates a 'Deliverability Score' for every address. This score, based on numerous factors such as route complexity and past driver experiences, provides valuable insights to recipients. They can take proactive steps to enhance their address's deliverability or gain a realistic expectation of potential delivery timeframes. Continuous Feedback Loop: As more drivers utilize our app, their feedback and experiences continuously refine and update our system. This ensures that the guidance provided is ever-evolving, benefiting from the collective experience of all past deliveries to that address. While many delivery systems focus on the broader aspects of the delivery route, we zero in on the final, critical stretch, ensuring that what has traditionally been a pain point becomes a seamless and efficient experience. In our venture, we're carving out a unique space in the AI industry by focusing solely on empowering small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with accessible and affordable AI solutions tailored to their specific needs. While others focus on individual consumers or large enterprises, we see the potential and unique challenges of the SMB market. Our mission is to bridge the gap between AI technologies and the SMB world by developing a suite of AI-powered tools that seamlessly integrate with their existing workflows, allowing SMBs to harness the benefits of AI without the steep learning curve or high costs often associated with these cutting-edge technologies. What sets us apart is our hands-on approach to understanding the SMB landscape. We've been working closely with local businesses like YoPo and The Pitch, collaborating with them to develop AI solutions that address their specific pain points. This direct engagement has led to the creation of innovative tools such as an automated inventory purchasing system that can buy any inventory item from any website based on the amount and name of the item, a price change notification system that analyzes past inventory purchase data from providers like US Foods and Pride of the Morning to alert users of undue price changes and recommend when and how much inventory to purchase in the future, and a data management tool that takes all data from Toast and arranges it in a setup optimized for accounting and machine learning purposes. These tools demonstrate our commitment to solving real-world challenges SMBs face and showcasing our AI solutions' tangible impact. By leveraging our understanding of the SMB landscape and our expertise in developing cutting-edge AI tools, we're excited to be at the forefront of making AI accessible and impactful for SMBs, ultimately empowering them to thrive in an increasingly competitive and technology-driven business environment.","Active website, incorporated in DE, File Number: 2623619, (Tiffany, 2-1-24) DE registration active, website active, phone updated (John 5/10/24).

Going through the process myself, I found the insights of my older brother invaluable to avoid costly mistakes that would have forced me to reapply in the following cycle. As a software engineer, I was able to encapsulate the insider knowledge from the entire process with Medtrackr using the best data available. For prospective medical school applicants, Medtrackr will generate the optimum list of schools to apply to based on a model trained on over 50 features (e.g. GPA, MCAT score, demographics). This helps students save money (i.e. not applying to an out-of-state school that accepts little or no out of state applicants) or even have a better chance of success (i.e. applying to a school that places more of an emphasis on service when a student has a lot of community service hours). Additionally, Medtrackr helps premed students track all the important metrics that go into a successful medical school application. I have compiled a comprehensive list of university courses for all classes offered in undergraduate institutions in the United States over the last 10 years (something like 5 million classes!). This information is used to quickly calculate the GPA of a premed student. Extracurricular activities and MCAT scores can also be tracked with trend detection to help students improve before it is too late. Medtrackr also features a cutting edge essay writing center which uses an NLP model to proofread student essays that are required throughout the application process. These essays often have a significant impact on the success of an applicant, so it is critical that they are optimized for both turnaround time and content. These are only a few examples of how Medtrackr harnesses the power of big data to give premeds an advantage when applying to medical school. It is the first tool of its kind to take this data driven approach, and there has been tremendous product market fit and demonstration of demand so far!","LLC active (Patrick, 6/23/2022).

In order to do this, we arrange a purchase agreement between Northstate Equity LLC and the homeowner. From there, we match the property to an investor in our network that fits their investment criteria and assign the contract to them, getting paid upon closing. This is a simple process that is used by many investors across the country commonly referred to as ?wholesaling?, but we have separated ourselves by leveraging technology to streamline our process and make data-driven business decisions. The key to our business lies in our off-market lead generation and cutting-edge marketing solutions. Our processes are 100% data-driven and fully integrated, allowing us to optimize important key performance indicators such as contact rate, conversion rate, and client retention rate. Since the founding of our company in 2020, we have heavily invested in technology and software that allow us to precisely identify our target market and enhance results on every marketing dollar that is spent. Aside from our unparalleled systems and processes, we are uniquely driven by a goal to help solve the affordable housing crisis in our home state of North Carolina. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there is a shortage of 190,910 affordable rental homes in North Carolina for low-income renters in 2022. Through networking with countless investors in our industry, we have come to realize the unfortunate reality that most people are more focused on profit rather than the affordability issues that need to be solved. It is because of this that we carefully qualify each investor in our network to ensure they share a similar mission in their work. We specifically target distressed homes that are currently vacant so that we can do our part in restoring the property and providing housing without displacing any renters. Although we are still a small business, we are fueled by working towards something that is much bigger than ourselves and believe that we can make a difference by taking it one property at a time.","LLC active, 2022 annual report filed (Patrick, 6/23/2022)","Website is still active, NC SoS status as ""Current - active,"" latest annual report 4/16/2023.

Unfortunately, the excessive nutrient output of large scale aquaculture has the potential to impact the world?s marine environment in the same way land-based agriculture has degraded soils, grasslands and forest ecosystems. To avoid transferring well-established but tremendously destructive agricultural practices into the marine environment, holistic ocean farming methodologies that prioritize the health of marine ecosystems must be designed and implemented before the industry grows in scale. For the past year, our team has taken preliminary steps to design and implement a new model for macroalgae cultivation in temperate ocean water ? coastal conditions associated with some of the world?s largest human populations and threatened ecosystems. By its cultivation strategy and integrated technologies, the project is designed to provide a new source of protein, carbohydrates, salt, and other nutrients to the national and international communities. Ideally, the project will demonstrate the viability of macroalgae cultivation in warm water conditions: an initiative that could serve to expand the range and improve the productivity of the aquaculture industry, provide new sources of food for livestock and animals, and reduce pressures on traditional food production practices. Ours is a food production, climate stabilization and economic development initiative with profound implications for the health of our fragile planet, and the species that call it home.","Incorporated in Delaware as Phyta, Inc.; 3rd place Late venture winner of the 2018 Carolina Challenge.",,"Liquidation, close down",3/31/2020,,

In some cases, the PEGylated drug represents the last-line of treatment, such as PEG-uricase for treatment of chronic tophaceous refractory gout. In other cases (e.g. pegaspargase (PEG-ASNase; for treatment of acute lymboblastic leukemia), the PEG-drug represents part of the most effective treatment regimen. For many PEGylated drugs, there are no viable alternative treatments. Unfortunately, with a number of PEGylated drugs, anti-PEG antibodies (APA) can be readily induced in humans that leads to loss of efficacy and increased risk of infusion reactions (IR), including anaphylaxis. For instance, APA is directly responsible for loss of efficacy in ~50% of patients treated with Krystexxa (PEG-uricase), with IR observed in ~60% of APA+ patients. Similarly, APA is directly responsible for loss of efficacy in ~40% of the patients treated with Oncospar (PEG-asparaginase). In other cases, such as Palynziq (PEGvaliase; for treatment of phenylketonuria), APA is induced in 100% of patients, and is directly responsible for a black box warning for anaphylaxis. SOLUTION: The underlying technology is the use of high molecular weight free PEG (MW >20 kDa), to be given either before or used in conjunction with PEGylated drugs that are at risk of inducing APA, or PEGylated drugs given to patients with already established high titers of APA. We have shown that this can effectively reduce APA, restore prolonged circulation of PEGylated drugs despite repeated dosing, and reduce allergic reactions to PEGylated drugs.","No website, date of legal incorporation is approximate via Judy Prasad (Tiffany, 7-17-23).

Additional features or changes are easily implemented, with the AI generating new tasks and seamlessly integrating them into the workflow. Detailed Sub-Task Generation: Within each feature generated, Skalara?s AI creates relevant tasks. If a generated task is too broad, the user can generate sub-tasks, allowing for atomic control over the steps taken to complete a project. Intelligent Team Assignments: Our platform focuses on your team's strengths and assigns tasks based on individual team members' past performances, ensuring efficiency and smooth workflows. While there are several prominent players in the project management arena, such as Asana, Jira, and ClickUp, our approach differentiates us in two significant ways: our user personas and our inherent integration of AI. Many established platforms market themselves as all-encompassing solutions suitable for various teams across different sectors. Though this broad approach has served them well, it allows us to carve out a specialized niche. By centering our attention on small tech teams and indie developers, we can address specific challenges and nuances this segment faces, which broad-spectrum platforms may overlook. In other words, we are a vertical startup while our competitors are horizontal. This niche focus enables the second, and perhaps the more vital, differentiation: our AI-driven foundation. Rather than treating AI as an added feature, we've embedded it at the core of our platform. This allows for optimized task generation tailored to tech teams and developers. Generalized platforms aiming to cater to every team type would struggle to integrate such AI capabilities because AI, by its nature, excels when given a specific context and can hallucinate when given ambiguous data","Active website, incorporated in DE, File Number: 7474682, (Tiffany, 2-1-24) Incorpoated DE and website active, X (twitter) not updated since 1/2024 (John 5/26/24). nothing on founder's LinkedIn website - graduate school and internship instead, marking inactive, Cindy 8/3/2024",,,,,

Additionally we are launching a podcast in 2023 that will discuss music as well as the DIY (Do It Yourself) ethos with independent record label owners, podcasters, and musicians.

For this event, we met with a metalworker, who was able to design a foot-shaped funnel cake ring concept, allowing for Big Foot Funnel Cake Prints (also will be used at UNC events for the Tar Heel Cakes). Unfortunately, the festival was rained out, so the product has not been tested. Additionally, our small business allows us to cut the middle man out, like munchees, to deliver fresh food, usually cheaper than the prepackaged products.

After converting Chapel Hill?s Frank Porter Graham Elementary School into a dual language school, we struggled to find curriculum that was written to support bilingual and biliterate proficiency, and we were forced to write our own. After talking with many other dual language schools and going to many dual language conferences, we realized this is a large problem across America. Schools are very eager to purchase curriculum to be taught in the classroom, but there is very little that exists for the dual language schools, and what is out there is poor in quality. We created the Viva Biliteracy blog to see what traction we could get, and we were pleasantly surprised by the web traffic and user registrations. At a conference, we pitched the idea of developing curriculum units and packaging this for sale to other K-5 schools while providing professional development sessions to complement those units and other instructional needs.

Xanthon is developing a diagnostic kit for genetically detecting cancers and hundreds of different infectious agents. It is based on an invention by Thorp that represented a new method of genetic diagnostics using advanced electrochemistry to detect DNA and identify its structure. In Thorp?s technique, special compounds called mediators are used to carry electrons from DNA or RNA, another nucleic acid, to electrodes, producing an electrical signal that indicates the presence and quantity of a genetic material.

Yoomi addresses these issues by providing a web platform that extends physical therapy treatment into the home, and enables patients to receive guidance on their exercise form through gamified workouts in front of a phone or laptop camera. Data from the workout is also collected in order to help physical therapists make better decisions regarding treatment and care, and help patients improve their form over time. By offering an exciting experience that guides patients to perform their exercises correctly and safely, physical therapists can improve patient outcomes (and receive higher insurance reimbursement through MIPS), decrease patient visit times, attract more patients, and increase patient engagement rates. Currently, there is no solution on the market that provides real-time feedback on patient home exercise form without the need for hardware sensors. Yoomi offers a zero hardware solution, and therefore maximizes accessibility and cuts costs. Further, Yoomi?s decision to target healthcare professionals as opposed to the direct-to-consumer market will enable Yoomi to develop credibility by leveraging the current healthcare system, allowing Yoomi to develop a stronger brand than its competitors such as Hinge and SWORD, which have chosen to target the direct-to-consumer market. Yoomi?s heavy emphasis on gamification aims to enable PTs to keep their patients better engaged than any other product on the market. Finally, Yoomi enables PTs to adjust a workout?s sets, reps, required range of motion, speed, and patient posture with Yoomi?s flexible computer vision technology to completely tailor workouts to each patient?s needs.","maybe incorporated DE as Yoomi Health Inc on 3/16/2022 (Cindy, 5/10/2022), confirmed active (Patrick, 6/24/2022).
